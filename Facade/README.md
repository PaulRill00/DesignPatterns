# Facade Pattern

A Facade is basically an eazier way to manage a lot of different depencies that are tied together.
In this sample project I have made a simple computer. The three different components need each other in order for the computer to work.

Now, the user that is using this libary can just use computer.Start(), instead of managing all the different depencencies themselves.
